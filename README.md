# Architecting-with-Google-Kubernetes-Engine-

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that helps you orchestrate and manage your container infrastructure on-premises or in the cloud.

It automates the deployment, scaling, load balancing, logging, monitoring, and other management features of containerized applications. These are the features that are characteristic of typical platform-as-a-service solutions. Kubernetes also facilitates the features of infrastructure-as-a-service, such as allowing a wide range of user preferences and configuration flexibility.

Google Kubernetes Engine is a managed Kubernetes service on Google infrastructure. GKE helps you to deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes environments for your containerized applications on Google Cloud.More specifically, GKE is a component of the Google Cloud compute offerings. It makes it easy to bring your Kubernetes workloads into the cloud.


Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers via web requests or Pub/Sub events. Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management so you can focus on developing applications. It is built on Knative, an open-source, Kubernetes-based platform. It builds, deploys, and manages modern serverless workloads. Cloud Run gives you the choice of running your containers either fully-managed or in your own GKE cluster.

Cloud Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute service for simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events. In Cloud Functions, you simply upload your code written in JavaScript, Python, or Go; Google Cloud will automatically deploy appropriate computing
capacity to run that code.

We will Deploy and manage containerized applications on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and the other tools on Google Cloud

• Deploy solution elements—including infrastructure components like pods, containers, deployments, and services—along with networks and application services

• Deploy practical solutions, including security and access management, resource management, and resource monitoring
